Interactive Learning Dashboard for IITM BS Students
The Interactive Learning Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to assist IITM BS students
in tracking their academic progress, planning their studies, and setting goals to maximize their
CGPA or marks. Here's how the dashboard can be adapted to include the roadmap and cater
specically to the unique structure of the IITM BS program:
Core Features
1. Progress Tracker by Term

and End Term).
• Score Breakdown:
◦ Display achieved scores and weightage for each exam.
◦ Highlight areas for improvement based on performance trends.
• Cumulative CGPA Calculator: Predict the CGPA based on current and expected
performance.
2. Roadmap Generator
• Customized Roadmap:
◦ Provide a suggested study schedule based on the current term's syllabus and exam
dates.
◦ Highlight important milestones (e.g., completing modules, taking mock tests).
• Goal Setting:
◦ Allow students to set target marks for each exam and track progress.
◦ Recommend study intensity based on the gap between current and target
performance.
• Actionable Tips: Offer guidance on study strategies, time management, and module
priorities.
3. Performance Analytics
• Mock Quiz Insights:
◦ Provide detailed analytics for mock quizzes, including strengths and weaknesses by
topic.
◦ Suggest additional resources for weaker areas.
• Peer Comparisons:
◦ Display anonymized comparisons with peers to help students gauge their standing.
◦ Recommend strategies based on percentile ranking.
4. Interactive Visualizations
• Dynamic charts to track progress over time.
• Heatmaps showing study time distribution and its correlation with performance.
5. Resource Recommendations
• Syllabus-Aligned Suggestions: Recommend IITM BS-specic resources, such as recorded
lectures, past papers, or faculty notes.
• External Resources: Curate external videos, articles, or tools for additional learning.
6. Community Engagement
• Discussion boards for students to share study tips and ask questions.
• Virtual study groups based on similar performance levels or target goals.
Making it Dynamic and Engaging
Personalization
• Use machine learning to analyze quiz scores and study patterns to offer personalized
recommendations.
• Dynamic content such as motivational messages, study tips, and insights based on the
student’s performance.
Term-Specic Insights
• Highlight term-specic challenges (e.g., foundational concepts in Term 1 or advanced
modules in Term 3).
• Provide a Term Roadmap for incoming students that outlines key focus areas, exam
strategies, and tips for balancing coursework.
Gamication
• Introduce badges for achieving milestones (e.g., completing mock quizzes, improving weak
areas).
• Leaderboards to foster healthy competition among peers.
Technical Implementation
Frontend
• Framework: React.js or Angular for a responsive and interactive user experience.
• Charts: D3.js or Chart.js for rich visualizations.
Backend
• Framework: Node.js with Express.js or Python Django for handling user data and analytics.
• Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing scores, study logs, and term-specic data.
Machine Learning
• Use libraries like TensorFlow.js or Scikit-learn to build recommendation engines and
performance predictors.
Deployment
• Hosting: AWS or Azure for scalability.
• CDN: Cloudare for quick content delivery.
